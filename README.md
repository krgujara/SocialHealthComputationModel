###Background:
The paper derives its motivation from the tournament conducted by a political scientist Robert Axelrod, who pioneered research to find out the optimal strategy in the late1970’s. Axelrod used the Prisoner's Dilemma to find the optimal strategy.
This work is an extension of “Study of the growth of a particular strategy in the pool of strategies” written by Miss Komal Gujarathi (self) and Miss Snehal More which won 1st place in ”Credenz” paper presentation competition organized by PVG Engineering college.
